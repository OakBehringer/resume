				<section class="intro">
					<article>
						<p>I am <span class="text-primary me">Adam Kosecki</span>, a highly-analytical application developer
							with 15+ years of professional experience. MVP criteria focused, my teams build things that are
							lean and clean; from straightforward, comprehensible design elements to robust, pivotable code.</p>
						<p>I strive to understand the problem we are solving from all angles before outlining a solution. My
							solutions are a fair compromise between speed and quality; form and function; seriousness and fun.</p>
						<p>I am a leader. I make decisions when appropriate, and defer or delegate without shame.
							People respect me and enjoy working with me.</p>

							<div class="job-held-details">
								<span class="title">Principal Developer</span>
								<span class="timespan">2019 - Present</span>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>Latchel is a property maintenance automation platform that handles the entire lifecycle
							of a maintenance request, including intake, diagnostics, contractor sourcing, scheduling,
							payment processing, and communications. It frees property managers from the labor-intensive
							task of coordinating repairs between tenants, contractors, and property owners.</p>

						<p>As the companyâ€™s first technical hire, I was in a position to provide daily impact for
							the organization. I formed a strong relationship with the product team, led the engineers,
							and architected our biggest solutions, including:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>An AI powered maintenance request intake process that simplified request submission
								from a 10 step diagnostic process to a single form input, reducing submission time
								from minutes to seconds. The solution increased problem identification accuracy and
								eliminated junk requests.</li>
							<li>Automated, prioritized contractor queue to dispatch work offers. The solution eliminated
								redundant, error-prone human operations while providing more predictable SLAs.</li>
							<li>Pivoted the product focus to offer an integrated experience, allowing our software
								partners to embed our contractor sourcing application into their own property management
								software, within minutes. The solution provided a seamless experience for their
								customers; allowing them to create and manage maintenance coordination without
								leaving their app.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>SpotMii was created to provide fitness consumers a way to discover new and exciting
							fitness facilities, and streamline the payment and check-in process for individuals
							that frequent multiple gyms. Users could purchase single-use passes for drop-in access and
							scheduled classes. Payments and scheduling were handled in-app.</p>

							versions of our apps that enabled us to secure an angel round of funding. We completed and
							launched the product in early 2019.</p>
